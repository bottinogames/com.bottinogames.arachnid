# Arachnid: Unity for web, simplified
Arachnid is comprised of 2 pieces: 
1. The Arachnid web template, which is a minimal web template with added functionality to fill the containter it is in.
2. BlaseSpry, a post-build function that removes the warning message displayed when opening Unity WebGL builds on mobile devices.
This allows for dynamic resolution that is mobile and desktop friendly, with a no-frills template that shows nothing but your game.

## Using Arachnid
The latest .unitypackage can be [found here.](https://github.com/Kelpow/com.bottinogames.arachnid/releases) Arachnid just needs to be imported into the project, and the Arachnid web template needs to be selected in Build Settings.

NOTE:
When using Arachnid with itch.io, make sure that your embed options are set to 'Click to launch in fullscreen' rather than 'Embed in page'. 

## Example
Arachnid can be seen in action in the game [Astral Ascent](https://bottino-games.itch.io/astral-ascent).
